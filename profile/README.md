## Overview

SuperSwink is a single-user personal agent designed with complete privacy and user autonomy. All data is stored locally by default, with no telemetry or third-party data sharing.

## Key Principles

- **Single-user focus** - Designed exclusively as a personal agent system
- **Privacy-first** - Complete user data ownership, local-first architecture
- **Standards-based** - Leverages established protocols and SDKs over custom implementations
- **Test-driven** - TDD mandate for all production code
